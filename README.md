# JourneyVista
JourneyVista is a culturally immersive and AI-powered travel planning platform that reimagines the way people explore the diverse landscapes of India.

It curates customized travel itineraries based on individual preferences such as cultural interests, adventure levels, historical curiosity, culinary tastes, and festival participation. The platform showcases hidden gems, unexplored destinations, indigenous art forms, local traditions, and region-specific celebrations, allowing travelers to connect deeply with the culture and soul of each state. Users can explore their journey through interactive maps and receive real-time updates on weather conditions, upcoming events, transport status, and more—making the planning process seamless and responsive. By promoting lesser-known but culturally significant sites, JourneyVista also supports sustainable and responsible tourism, helping local communities while enriching the traveler’s experience. Whether it's discovering a tribal dance in Odisha, savoring street food in Lucknow, or attending a temple festival in Tamil Nadu, JourneyVista transforms travel into a meaningful and memorable journey.
